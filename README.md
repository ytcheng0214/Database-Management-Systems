# Database-Management-Systems
Our project involves creating a website for three physical clothing stores.

The main difference from the online stores we are used to seeing nowadays is that the
customer can choose and book online the clothes he/she wants to try on or buy, and then
go to the corresponding physical shop, try on the chosen clothes and eventually buy them.

In order to make a preliminary analysis of the data, we are going to create a database that
will allow us to store and process the historical sales data of the fashion industry in a
better way.
